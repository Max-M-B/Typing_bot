I don't know what to include in a readme file, so I'll just explain the project. I want to learn python by working on a project. I like typing and watched a youtube video about creating a typing bot so I thought that I would try making one too.

How to use the nitrotype and typeracer bot:
* When you run the code a chrome browser will pop up and automatically direct you to the website
* Go into a race
* press "ctrl+alt+h" when the race starts
* sit back and relax as the bot types at world-class speeds
